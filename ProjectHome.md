# Introduction #

The [Center for Domain Specific Computing](http://www.cdsc.ucla.edu) has created a collection of algorithms and test images for the purposes of accelerating medical image processing tasks. The goal is to provide optimized algorithms for performing image reconstruction, restoration, registration, and segmentation to support quantitative image analysis. We are making the original algorithms and variants available for public use.

# Purpose #
The release of these algorithms and datasets is to provide members of the research community access to representative algorithms that are being used in non-trivial medical imaging applications. CDSC has been using these algorithms and datasets as a benchmark for evaluating heterogeneous computing platforms and code optimization strategies. These implementations are now being made available "as-is" to researchers who wish to validate or compare their implementations.

# Revision History #
  * The initial release occurred in September 2011 and included algorithms related to 3D denoising, fluid registration, and segmentation. Information about this release can be [found here](https://code.google.com/p/cdsc-image-processing-pipeline/wiki/MedicalBenchmarkVersion1).
  * **NEW** A second release occurred in September 2014 and included algorithms related to an adaptive reconstruction pipeline for pulmonary nodule detection. Information about this release can be [found here](https://code.google.com/p/cdsc-image-processing-pipeline/wiki/CDSC_CAD_Pipeline).
